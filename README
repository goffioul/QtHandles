QtHandles is licensed under GPL v3 or higher.

The icons used in QtHandles are from the Crystal icon set and are licensed
under LGPL. See http://www.everaldo.com/crystal/ for more information.

Requirements
------------

- octave >= 3.7 (current development branch).
- Qt >= 4.7

Compilation
-----------

Use the following commands:

	qmake
	make

These commands assume that octave is available somewhere in your PATH. If
this is not the case, the recommended way to compile QtHandles is the
following:

	PATH=/where/octave/is/installed/bin:$PATH qmake -recursive
	make

Running from sources
--------------------

QtHandles can be run from sources, using the simple wrapper provided:

	./tools/octave-qt

This wrapper runs octave in CLI mode, but provides the necessary framework
to run a Qt application. This wrapper is not required if you're running
octave using the GUI (only available in octave >= 3.7).

Installing
----------

Use the following command:

	./install.sh

This command assumes that octave is available in your PATH. If this is not
the case, use the following command:

	PATH=/where/octave/is/installed/bin:$PATH ./install.sh

Activating QtHandles
--------------------

QtHandles is activated in octave like any other toolkit. Type the following
at octave prompt:

	graphics_toolkit qt
